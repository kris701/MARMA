# Barman (Sequential, Agile)

## Domain Description

In this domain, there is a robot barman that manipulates drink dispensers, glasses, and a shaker.
The goal is to find a plan of the robot’s actions that serves a desired set of drinks.
In this domain deletes of actions encode relevant knowledge given that robot hands can only grasp one object at a time and given that glasses need to be empty and clean to be filled.
